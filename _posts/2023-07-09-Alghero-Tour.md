Alghero is a coastal city on the island of Sardinia, Italy. Situated in the Mediterranean climate, Alghero has warm weather year around, accompanied by soft ocean breezes and a sunny, clear sky. The moisture here is high, and the sunshine can get too strong at times, but overall very soothing weather. 

This is the house of a rich Catalan family back when they first conquered Alghero. Alghero was first occupied by people from Geneva. The Catalans were from the Barcelona regions. They defeated the Genevans in a sea battle off the coast of Alghero and took over the city. 

This picture portrays one of the altars of the biggest church in Alghero. The construction of this church began back in the 1500s, and did not finish until the 1800s due to lack of funding. The domes were constructed in Catalan style, which is more rounded than other places in Europe. In the more recent days, with the aid of modern technology, the church was expanded. It now has a modern front side and a historic back side. 

This is the bell tower of the church. It is the tallest structure of Alghero, standing at 40ish meters. The bell tower is on the backside of the church was constructed by the Catalans.

This is the back gate of the church. The construction of the church began here, and you can see the church Catalan style dome. The Catalans combined with Spain after its ruling family married into Spanish royalties. The groom was Ferdinand, and the bride Isabella. The couple’s face is part of the dome, very small but visible. Pay attention to the small spheres along the dome. Follow the spheres down the dome and you will find their faces are at the bottom, with the bride on the right and groom in the left. 

This is the house of a Catalan middle class. The left door is the main door, for people. The right door is the animal door, for donkeys and horses. Above the main door is the family crest. Each window also has a unique decoration. 

This is the picture of a bishops house. Across from the bishops house is one of the few theatres in Sardinia that still has wooden flooring. A lot of the theatres were damaged during the bombings in WWII. Speaking of the bombing, there was only one square/plaza in Alghero before WWII. After the bombings near the end of the war, a lot of ancient buildings in Alghero collapsed completely. Some were reconstructed, while others were cleared out and replaced by squares/plazas. 

This is just an example of an alley. 

Bubble tea exists here too!

This is a jewellery store, with mainly coral jewellery. Sardinia has one of the best corals in the world. The corals here are orange, and only grows 5 centimetres a year, while corals elsewhere can grow up to 40cm a month. To harvest, divers dive 50-120 meters to the see floor, harvest for 25 minutes and return. The round trip takes 3.5 hours, excluding the harvest time. There are only 14 licensed coral divers in Sardinia. These conditions makes Sardinian coral one of the rarest on the planet. 

This is the land gate tower of old town Alghero. Alghero is surrounded by water on 3 sides. This tower marks the gate that used to guard Alghero from land invaders. When the Catalans defeated the Genevans, they took down the smaller Genevan tower and built their own (this one). There used to ve 24 more towers like this around Alghero. Connected by walls, they mark the perimeter of Old Alghero. Now, the land segments have been taken down to allow city expansion. Alghero has grown from a town of 8000 people to a city of 45000 people. 

This is one of the preserved bastion wall segments. The walls and towers are made of sandstone, volcanic stones, and limestones. Sandstones are lighter and easier to make, so its bricks are more regular. Volcanic stones can be regular or irregular. Sardinia used to have 23 volcanos,  but they are all dormant now with the last eruption over 100,000 years ago. The volcanic stones were formed by these volcanos long long ago. Lastly, the centre of Sardinia are mountains made of limestone. This island used to be in the bottom of the sea floor, hence the richness in limestone. 

This is a reconstruction of Alghero. 

This is one of the 24 bastion towers. Unlike the one we saw before, this one borders the ocean, and is used to defend against sea-side invaders. 

These are houses by the ocean. Long ago, Alghero residents near the ocean did not leave windows on the side of their house that faces the ocean. This is because 1. They are mostly fisherman so they’ve seen enough of the sea, and 2. To protect the interior of their house against the salty sea wind. In the 1960s, Alghero welcomed its first wave of actual tourists. As tourism grew, the coastal residents opened windows on their sea-facing walls in order to sell their house for a higher price. At that time, they painted their windows blue and green: blue for fishermen, and green for farmers. 

This is the old dock of Alghero. The building in the middle used to be a convent, and the building to its right was a hospital ran by the nuns. Now, the hospital has become the department of architecture of the University of Sassari. 

These are pictures of the modern Alghero dock. This dock is the largest dock for private boats in Italy, housing 2500-3000 boats year round. 

This is the old Seagate of Alghero. Sailors would enter the city through the dome on the right. 

This is one of the remaining segments of the old bastion, called Bastione Della Maddelena, named after the now-non-existent statue of Maddelena on top of it. 

This is a pic of the boat used for coral harvesting back in the 1800-1900s. The harvesters rode boats like this and scraped the ocean floor with heavy nets. This heavily damaged the ecosystem and are now banned. 

This concludes my tour of Alghero. Thank you for reading :)
