When planning the trip to Italy, one of the first things I thought of was dinner plans. The idea of having whatever Italian cuisine I wanted for a week made me overjoyed. After a 17+ hour plane trip, 2 lay-overs, and a two hour drive across the island of Sardinia, the first thing I did after checking in at the AirBnB was to find the nearest local *Ristorante*, or restaurant, and satisfy my cravings.

## Day 1 - La Biofra

The first restaurant we went to was a local restaurant just 2 minutes away from my AirBnB. It is called *La Biofra*. Situated in a small open area, *La Biofra* is surrounded by residential buildings on 3 sides, with the last facing the harbour of Alghero. When we arrived, we were seated in the open. The atmosphere created by the lighting, layout, and the ambient Italian chattering was sublime.

Once we were seated, the waitors presented us with the menues.

Italian menus are divided into the following sections: 

Italian | English
Antipasti | Appetizers
Primi | First Course
Secondi | Second Course
Contorni | Sides/Main
Pizze | Pizza
Desserti | Dessert
Vin | Wine. 

Different restaurants may have differnt layouts, with different names and/or additional sections. For example, one resturant I went to had an extra "combo" section. Since Alghero is situated by the Mediterranean Ocean, many restaurants also split their *Primi* and *Secondi* section into *Terra*, which means land, and *Mare*, which means Ocean. Most of the time, I only choose one from either Primi or Secondi and it is enough to fill me decently. This would typically cost Less than 20 Euros. 

Can't say you have tried Italian food until you have had their pizza! With this mindset, the very ever first dish I ordered at an Italian resturant in Italy was a pizza. *Napul'e* was its name, and it was rich with ingredients: *fior de latte, fresh sausage, friarielli, uncooked buffalo mozzeralla, basil, and extra virgin olive oil*. *Fior de latte* is a very common ingredient in Italian cuisine. It literally translates to "Flowers of Milk", and is used to describe milk or milk products produced with the highest quality of milk. TODO: INSERT DESCRIPTION OF FRIARIELLI. Because we went very late at night, the restaurant ran out of uncooked buffalo mozzeralla, and offered to replace it with some good quality Riccota. Below are the pictures of the pizza.

This was one of the best pizzas I have every had. The pizza was freshly baked with a crispy, thin crust. The cheese on the pizza was very rich and stretchy, which the riccota on top were soft and creamy. The Friarieli were crunchy, and added a unique texture to the otherwise uniform pizza. The sausage were indeed fresh, with just the right amount of salt to enhance the flavour of the sauce and the cheese. Lastly, the basil on top added a nice touch of herb flavour, delicately balancing the acidity of the cheese and the meat. 

The pizza was 12 Euros, with a *Coperto* of 3 Euros. Unlike North America, where we pay tax and tip on top of the food, European resturants include tax in their food costs and uses *coperto*, a base charge per diner, in place of tip. Combined with a 3 Euro drink, this dinenr costed me 18 Euros total, which is about CAD $27.

## Day 2 - Convenient Store Excursion

On the second day, I walked around Old Town Alghero and its newer urban expansions. I visited a local convenient store, *Eurospin*, and was very impressed by the shelfs of cheese and pasta.

Later I thought, maybe the amazement I felt after seeing the multitude of pasta types is shared by the Italians when they see the multitude of rice types...

## Day 2 - Il Vecchio Mulino

I decided to treat myself nicely after a whole day of work. My friend suggested another local restaurant called Il Vecchio Mulino, located in the heart of Old Town Alghero.

We went right as it opened, and were able to steal a 2-hour seat in the fully booked restaurant. The waitress sat us down in a cozy seat next to the bar.

Soon after we sat down, we were served a bread basket as starters.

Italian bread are mostly hard and chewy, with a slight hint of sour if you chew long enough. THey are usually served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Here, we were also given a cup of mozzerally cheese. The larger square at the back of the basket is very thin and crispy. I quickly became addicted to it and devoured every piece at later dinners. 

After trying the pizza on day 1, I wanted to try their pasta. I chose the *Pasti Di Vongole*, pasta with clam. The
